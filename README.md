# Automatic Controller Tuning using Black-Box Optimization 
This is the code used to generate the results in a recent paper titled "Data-Driven Scenario Optimization for Automated Controller Tuning with Probabilistic Performance Guarantees". The paper is under review at IEEE Control Systems Letters and has been uploaded to arxiv.

Note that CasADi (https://web.casadi.org) and the bayesopt function (https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/bayesopt.html) -- which is a part of the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox in Matlab -- must be installed in order for this code to run properly.
